    <p class="abouttext"><strong>Hi, my name is Kyle Jackson and I am a Motion Designer. In addition to Motion Design I enjoy UI/UX Design and Photography. Growing up I've always had an interest in art, in addition to visual arts I also really enjoy music. Sports are also a big part of my life and as a result, I sometimes like to incorporate my passion for sports into my own work.</strong></p>
